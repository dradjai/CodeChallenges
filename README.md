## Completed and Solved the following code challenges from Hackerrank in Java

### 1. Encryption Decryption
   
   Problem: Decrypt a message that was encrypted using the following logic:
   
   
      1.   First the words in the sentence are reversed. For
           example. "welcome to hackerrank" becomes
           "hackerrank to welcome".
        
        
      2.   For each word, adjacent repeated letters are
           compressed in the format <character>
           «frequency>. For example, "mississippi" becomes
           "mis2is2ip2'" or "baaa" becomes "ba3". Note the
           format is not applied for characters with
           frequency 1. Also, the frequency will be no
           greater than 9.
           Return the decrypted string.
  
### 2. Permutation Equation
  
      1.   Given a sequence of n integers, p(1),p(2),…,p(n) 
           where each element is distinct and satisfies 1 <= p(x) <= n. 
           For each x where 1 <= x <= n, find any integer y such that p(p(y)) = x 
           and print the value of y on a new line.
